# Federated High-Performance Computing with Slurm and AWS

This project aims to provide hands-on experience in building and managing high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, showcasing their federation capabilities for real-world use cases. The project plan consists of several milestones, each contributing to the overall objective of establishing a functional and scalable federated HPC environment.

**Milestone 1: Preparation**
  Established a team documentation portal on the class wiki to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.
  Set up a comprehensive project plan, outlining the tasks and milestones to be achieved.
  
**Milestone 2: Slurm Controller Build**
  Constructed and configured the Slurm controller, a vital component of the HPC cluster.
  Conducted rigorous testing to ensure the proper functioning of the Slurm controller.
  
**Milestone 3: Slurm Worker Node Build**
  Built and configured the Slurm worker nodes, essential for distributed processing within the HPC cluster.
  Verified the communication between the worker nodes and the Slurm controller.
  Successfully integrated individual nodes into the team cluster, ensuring seamless collaboration.
  
**Milestone 4: Account Provision**
  Provisioned user accounts on Slurm, enabling authorized access to the HPC cluster.
  
**Milestone 5: Integration and Testing**
  Integrated the Slurm controller with the worker nodes, establishing a cohesive system.
  Conducted extensive testing to ensure the integrated system's proper functionality and performance.
  
**Milestone 6: Optimization, Scaling, and Quality of Service (QoS)**
  Implemented optimization techniques to enhance the performance of the Slurm system.
  Scaled the HPC cluster to handle larger workloads, ensuring its adaptability.
  Configured Quality of Service (QoS) measures to prioritize and manage job queues effectively.
  
**Milestone 7: Advanced Parallel Jobs**
  Implemented advanced parallel job techniques, including job arrays and chain submission.
  Demonstrated the system's capability to efficiently handle complex computational tasks.
  
 The project will culminate in a comprehensive demonstration of the federated HPC clusters, showcasing their functionality and capabilities. A final report  documenting the project's journey, challenges, and outcomes will also be presented.
